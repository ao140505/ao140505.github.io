    I'm a web developer living in San Francisco. Some of my favorite
    things include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Vim</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>responsive websites</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you'd like to work with me, I'm <a
    href="mailto:alex.okolish@gmail.com">currently available
    </a> for consulting work.
  </p>

    Outside of coding, I love to cook and ride
    bikes in the mountains around the bay area.

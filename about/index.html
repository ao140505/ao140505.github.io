  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is Alex Okolish. I am a developer living in San Francisco who likes to writing ruby and appreciates a nice UI.</p>
  <p>When I’m not programming, you’re likely to find me cooking or riding a bike. This is me on a mountain bike ride in Virginia.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://recipes1.herokuapp.com/">Open Recipes</a> - for recipes - aims to be quicker, simpler, and more usable than the big recipe/cooking sites out there</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you want to get in touch, <a href="mailto:alex.okolish@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>

<div id="refactoring-on-rails">
  <h2 class="headline">Are you knee deep in crappy rails code?</h2>

  <p>
    Rails has enabled you to quickly turn your idea into reality. At first, everything about it was great.
  </p>

  <p>
    But it's getting harder and harder to ship new features. You're controllers have actions that are so long you
    have to scroll to read the whole thing.  You have callbacks triggering callbacks to the point that 
    you're not even sure what code runs when you save a model to the database.
  </p>

  <p>
    You know you should start refactoring your code. But every time you try, something goes wrong:
    you don't know where to start, you break things, and it takes forever.
  </p>

  <h2>Should you just give up on refactoring?</h2>

  <p>
    No. You just need to go back and power through those big book on refactoring you bought a while ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    But those books keeps putting you to sleep. You wish there was a way to get up to speed on refactoring
    that didn't take forever.
  </p>


  <h2>What if you could refactor like a boss?</h2>

  <p>
    Imagine what it would feel like to be able to refactor like a boss. What if you knew exactly how to improve
    that code you're struggling with.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>you'd feel fearless and in control when you decide to improve code </li>
    <li>your code would be cleaner and easier to understand </li>
    <li>you would discover and fix bugs more easily </li>
    <li>you'd quickly recognize code that should be refactored </li>
    <li>people would come to you when they need help improving their code </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Crappy code would have nowhere to hide.

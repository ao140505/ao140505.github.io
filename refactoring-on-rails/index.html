  <h2 class="headline">Are you knee deep in crappy rails code?</h2>

  <p>
    We've all been there - you're investigating another bug in your rails app. You open up the file and discover a mess of code that someone else wrote.
  </p>

  <p>
    You know the bug is in somewhere in there. Maybe you can fix it, but youâ€™re tired of chasing bugs throughout this code base.
  </p>

  <p>
    You want to improve the code while you're in there. But the last time you did that, you broke a few things.
  </p>

  <h2>Should you just give up on refactoring?</h2>

  <p>
    No. You just need to go back and power through that big book on refactoring you bought a few months ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    But that book keeps putting you to sleep. Isn't there a way to get up to speed on refactoring that doesn't take forever?
  </p>


  <h2>What if you could refactor like a boss?</h2>

  <p>
    It would feel great to know how to safely, and quickly improve crappy code whenever you find yourself working with it.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>you'd feel fearless and in control when you decide to improve code </li>
    <li>your code would be cleaner and easier to understand </li>
    <li>you would discover and fix bugs more easily </li>
    <li>you'd quickly recognize code that should be refactored </li>
    <li>people would come to you when they need help improving their code </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Crappy code would have nowhere to hide.

  <h2 class="headline">Are you knee deep in crappy rails code?</h2>

  <p>
    Rails helped you quickly turn your idea into reality. At first, everything about it was great. But it's getting harder and harder for you to ship new features.
  </p>

  <p>
    You end up controller actions so long they don’t even fit on your screen. You have callbacks triggering callbacks to the point that you're not sure what the heck is going to happen when you save a model.
  </p>

  <p>
    You know refactoring is the path to cleaner code…you’re just afraid you might break something or take too long for it to be worthwhile.
  </p>

  <h2>What if you could refactor like a boss?</h2>

  <p>
    What if you knew exactly how to improve bad code as soon as you run across it? You’d feel fearless, have cleaner code, and could get back to doing what you love - shipping awesome features.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's true, it can take time to learn how to refactor code…but it doesn't have to take years.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can help you learn how to refactor like a boss. You'll learn how to quickly clean up code, without fear and without breaking anything.

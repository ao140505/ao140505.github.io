I recently read this [question on a
forum](https://railsforum.com/topic/1156-getting-started-with-rails/)
 paraphrased as:

> I am very new to programming. Should I learn HTML, CSS, or
  Ruby before I learn rails?

Yes, you should.

## Learn the basics

All websites are built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript - you need to know these.
If you can look at sketch of a UI and code it up, you know enough
about HTML and CSS. If not, you should start there.

I also suggest you learn the basics of programming in ruby.  There are some great
online resources for learning this. Rails is going to make a lot more sense once
you have some knowledge ruby.

## Break Problems Down

Breaking big problems down into smaller chunks is a super useful skill. To
build a product using rails, you need to know Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS,
Javascript, how to deploy your site and more. How well do you think you can learn
all of those simultaneously? Not very well.

This same technique can be used when you are building websites. Building a
website is a lot of work. Breaking it up into small tasks will keep you focused
and keep you from feeling overwhelmed.

## Have fun

Learning how to program is hard work. Build something fun as you learn
to make it fun and stay motivated. For example, after I went through a book on
rails, I built a site for saving and sharing recipes because I was really into
cooking. Make something that is fun or useful for you.

## Shortcuts

They don't exist.

A website mentioned on this post implies that after completing their
**one month rails course** you will be capable of landing a $120,000
programming job. I can assure you that is bullshit.

It takes time and effort to master this stuff. I have been learning to
program for 6 years and still have plenty more to learn. You *do not* need a
computer science degree. You *do* need to be persistant and put in the work.
